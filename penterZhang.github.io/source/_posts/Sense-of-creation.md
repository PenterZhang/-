#### Let me talk about it first! It’s hard to do it! It took me two days to get it out! Still an incomplete! Sad, I want to cry.
 
#### Talk about the first problem I encountered!

```
The local operation is different. The reason is that the environment is wrong. I don't know that a certain npm package has been uninstalled. It can't be installed through npm. It can only be installed with cnpm.
```
#### 如下图

#### did you see that? I gave me such a big embarrassment when I came up. Although I have never used him in a year, I am still a child.

#### Then, the second question appeared! Please look carefully!

```
In the case of hexo d, I always encounter some strange problems. The first problem encountered by Auspicious Bedroom is that the XXX directory is an empty directory tree. (WTF!) What? ! Laozi named configuration is good! Right! For the wool!
```

#### To be continued... Still! I will tell you tomorrow!

#### Ok, start today's work, and continue to talk about some things I still encountered yesterday! It may be because many of the npm libraries that github was acquired by Microsoft could not be used, or it may be for other reasons! In short, it is getting harder and harder!

> The first question on today i is because the local configuration of the SSH key is incorrect and cannot be uploaded, so the hexo d caused by the root can not be deployed to Github. Please see the screenshot below.

```
Why is this problem occurring? There are several possibilities:
First, once a github.io was deployed and then removed, resulting in a domain name update that could not be resolved;
The second is that SSH is not configured locally or the SSH configuration is incorrect. There are several SSH key formats, just the one you generated is not in that format, so you cannot use it.
```

####  All right! The above are some of the problems I have encountered before. If you need help, please contact my QQ1992752625.
